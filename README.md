# redirector

> üèπ For redirecting to desktop apps

## Why I built this

I have a list in Notion that I want to use as my dashboard for beginning my work day. I want to use the desktop apps for most of my applications (least chance for distraction) and since Notion doesn't support deep links, e.g. `messenger://` I needed to create a service to redirect to the local apps.
